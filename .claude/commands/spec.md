description: Start spec-driven development — write a structured specification before writing code
---

Invoke the agent-skills:spec-driven-development skill.

Begin by understanding what the user wants to build. Ask clarifying questions about:
1. The objective and target users
2. Core features and acceptance criteria
3. Tech stack preferences and constraints
4. Known boundaries (what to always do, ask first about, and never do)

If the change touches an existing codebase, run the agent-skills:impact-analysis-with-gitnexus gate before writing the spec — it skips itself with a one-line note when GitNexus is not installed — and fold its Impact Report into Boundaries and Success Criteria.

Then generate a structured spec covering all six core areas: objective, commands, project structure, code style, testing strategy, and boundaries.

If the request bundles several independently testable capabilities, first propose a capability map (module ids, dependency direction, build order) per the skill's Phase 0 and get it approved, then spec each module in dependency order.

Save the spec as SPEC.md in the project root and confirm with the user before proceeding.
